# Classic Arcade Game Clone

This project is part of Udacity's frontend nanodegree. An implementation of the classic arcade game Frogger.

## Installation

After cloning the project, you can run the game by simply openning index.html file.
The game will start automatically and is played using the arrows on the keyboard.

## Instructions

The player can move in four directions, up, down, right and left. To win the game, the player must reach the water without colliding with the enemies (bugs). The score is increased by one whenever the player reaches the water and the player's location will reset. The player has three lives initially and will lose one once a collision occurs with an enemy. If all lives are lost, the score will reset to zero.
